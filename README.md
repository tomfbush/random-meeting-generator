# random-meeting-generator

Do you work in media? Do you find your time being stolen from you by endless meetings that you don't need to attend? Then use this script to generate plausible meeting names that you can put in your own calendar, and claim that time back without anybody knowing that all you want to do is get some work done!

Webapp on the way ;-)
